Description: 
    This R package provides  a unified flexible framework for simulating data 
    from a wide range of structured statistical models with ease of control. 
    The package support generation of independent and identically 
    distributed (IID) data under a variety of distributions, including user-defined 
    generators and copula-based multivariate sampling. It also includes 
    functions for generating data from different regression and mixed-effects models, 
    with customizable covariate distributions and error structures. 
    It also allows summarizing, printing and visualizing simulated data,
    as well as adding artificial contamination or censoring of various types.
