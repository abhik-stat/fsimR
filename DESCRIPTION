Description: 
    fsimR provides  a unified flexible framework for simulating datasets 
    from various statistical models, along with summarizing, printing and visualizing 
    simulated data. 
    The package support generation of independent and identically 
    distributed (IID) data under a variety of distributions, including user-defined 
    generators and copula-based multivariate sampling. It also includes 
    functions for generating data under linear models, generalized linear models, 
    mixed-effects models, and many more, with customizable covariate distributions, 
    regression coefficients, and error structures. The package is designed to support 
    reproducible simulation studies, teaching, benchmarking, and Monte Carlo experiments. 
    Its consistent interface and tidyverse-friendly design make it easy to extend 
    and integrate into larger statistical workflows.
